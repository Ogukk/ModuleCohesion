Dr. Vishwash Batra has highlighted a problem, whereby Keele university teaches very similar course content across different modules in the School of Computing and Mathematics at Keele University.  The school has started to take part in the apprenticeship scheme and are using modules from the Computer Science, Mathematics and Data Science courses to create the content for it.  However, without comparing lecture slides or course briefs to one and other, which is a timely process, there is no efficient way to complete a reconciliation process to ensure that content is not unnecessarily duplicated.
